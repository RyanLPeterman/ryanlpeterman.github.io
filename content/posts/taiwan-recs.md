Went to Taiwan (Taipei, Tainan, Taroko Gorge, Sun Moon Lake) for 20 days, tried dozens of restaurants and saw all the top sights. **Here are the top 3 places I ate at:**
- [Best Taiwanese Beef Noodle: Halal Chinese Beef Noodles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wzbWzLrj6zpSHMWRA)
- [Best Night Market Food: Fuzhou Pepper Buns (in Raohe night market)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DeiRv6nptDV815cs7)
- [Memorable Duck Place: Xiang Duck Taipei](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BiBPojSpfcfBvDaZ7)

**Top destination:** Taroko Gorge for sure. It's a national park in Taiwan with unique landscapes. We rented e-bikes from Hualien and biked up to it. We also stayed at an upscale hotel inside the park called ["Silk's Place"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/28RiiP5aS56e9E3W7). Highly recommend staying there if you don't mind the price.

**Honorable food mention:** If you like Taiwanese beef noodle soup, there's a great place called [Yongkang Beef Noodles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KoV7vhPyjEafpCz69) which has super rich broth. Some people say it's a tourist trap, I say it's delicious.
