            <description>Went to Taiwan (Taipei, Tainan, Taroko Gorge, Sun Moon Lake) for 20 days, tried dozens of restaurants and saw all the top sights. Here are the top 3 places I ate at:
 Best Taiwanese Beef Noodle: Halal Chinese Beef Noodles Best Night Market Food: Fuzhou Pepper Buns (in Raohe night market) Memorable Duck Place: Xiang Duck Taipei  Top destination: Taroko Gorge for sure. It&amp;rsquo;s a national park in Taiwan with unique landscapes.</description>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wzbWzLrj6zpSHMWRA">Best Taiwanese Beef Noodle: Halal Chinese Beef Noodles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DeiRv6nptDV815cs7">Best Night Market Food: Fuzhou Pepper Buns (in Raohe night market)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BiBPojSpfcfBvDaZ7">Memorable Duck Place: Xiang Duck Taipei</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Top destination:</strong> Taroko Gorge for sure. It&rsquo;s a national park in Taiwan with unique landscapes. We rented e-bikes from Hualien and biked up to it. We also stayed at an upscale hotel inside the park called <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/28RiiP5aS56e9E3W7">&ldquo;Silk&rsquo;s Place&rdquo;</a>. Highly recommend staying there if you don&rsquo;t mind the price.</p>
<p><strong>Honorable food mention:</strong> If you like Taiwanese beef noodle soup, there&rsquo;s a great place called <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/KoV7vhPyjEafpCz69">Yongkang Beef Noodles</a> which has super rich broth. Some people say it&rsquo;s a tourist trap, I say it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>

            <title>Reducing Instagramâ€™s basic video compute time by 94 percent</title>

            <description>Zuck (IG Post, FB Post) and some news outlets (ex1, ex2, ex3, ex4) highlighted some of the work our team did in video compute efficiency.
We reduced the cost to produce our basic video encodings by 94%. As a byproduct we were able to use that compute to improve advanced encoding watchtime coverage by 33%. These advanced encodings improve the user experience through higher visual quality and less stalls. If this sounds interesting to you, I wrote an engineering blog post with all the engineering details here</description>

            <description>Had a lot of fun partnering with the ads org on optimizing the performance of video ads, which had been neglected for some time. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading about how we reduced memory errors 98% and drove a 3.9% increase in watch time, check out the blog post here.</description>
